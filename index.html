   <p style="color:orange; background-color:purple; border-radius: 0 26px 0 26px; padding:12px;">I love to eat food because
      of my bad habit. I am always good to cook but somehow someone always try to insult me taht I am not. How it is possible? Always there is a shame eye on us. But we are good and better than him. He never
      try to take any chance to see us. What's wrong is going on. We are fine and nice as always but what's about him?
      who is he, what does he want? He always try to quarrelling with us but we are always with patience. Fear or tension
      or nothing can touch us. And we are such smart as him.
   </p>
   <p id="p2">There are so beautiful cars around our city. Red car blue car white car green car etc so so many cars. But where is his
      car? His car is at showroom now! It's funny that always funny talking with every people in this universe. Where is the
      value of his live? I always think how, how can he do these? Always on the foot... My father, daughter, sister, brother
      everyone is in love with him. But it can not be possible to live without him. He is not so much strong ; he says but I always
      see him fighting. I can not tolerate these at all, mom!
   </p>
   <p id="p3">I want to say and again I am saying to everyone that, if you try to follow him again I will not tolerate at all. I know
      and better know about him and the big differences between him. You all are going in vain forever. But the matter of joy
      that he how think that he is no one of mine I want to tell them that he is my husband for now and for ever. I cannot see
      him because of a matter of you. You are always being ugly day by day. From where you came? You do not know. What is your
      religion, what is your hobby, what is your work, for what you came here you never know. What can I do for you know? There
      is a sentence in this universe that without preceptor no one can stand. But you stand only with your legs. But your legs
      are also broken now. You broke it with your sin and became like an ugly human. I never want to think anything with you.

      <h1>My favourite places</h1>
      <p>I had a dream to travel with him and see this universe with him. He will try to find my mom and dad too. But they are his parents.
         I had nothing to do about this so. Because people will say I am his sister or aunty. But we never do. So It is their own business
         to think anything. But I am better to think only about him. He is my one and only lucky ticket I cut it thousand of years ago before
         my birth. But now he is my closed and one and only closest love. I want to pass each and every time with him with joy and laugh and
         want to thought about him. But the reality, our work which is most important we want to do this with our honest. Because our work
         brought us together. Sometimes I think that who is he. Answer is so easy that he is always mine but the problem is he never try to
         hide himself from me. I always think that he is always attentive about his work. Actually work is a thing which says that you and me
         always together and I am always yours because I see with your eyes. Yes, I have eyes with different attitude beside your playground
         where you and me stay together. So at last I want to say this universe I really and always want to travel as much as to start it ;
         I need his company. So welcome to me, time... when It will be coming true.

      <p>There is a proverb that, if you are always right then remember your Guru for one more time to keep your eyes on the right focus. Because
         there are so many danger in this universe like you can be lost in the time. You can know the time well but you will be lost because of
         a lack of your experience. But only your guru knows well about the right way of your path that's why he will ask you then, why you went
         there without experience? You will say 'from the intension of my mind, sir'. He will call you again to come back to your home and take
         rest to think it again to find the fault. Then you can get that your fault was not knowing your Guru's advice. You will understand
         the meaning of better system of learning. Otherwise your every effor will go in vain for ever. At last I want to say that to live in this
         universe you have to give your diligence at the right place and with a right way.
